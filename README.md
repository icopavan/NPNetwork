NPNetwork-v1.0
=========

A Matlab class for no propagation adaptive neural network. This adaptive neural network model is developed by Prof. Bernard Widrow's research group at Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. This Matlab class is developed by Yizheng Liao, a PhD student at Stanford University.

In v1.0, we implemented the following features:
1. Training the neural network with only LMS adaptive layers. This feature can be used to model the linear system.
2. Training the neural network with hidden layers and LMS adaptive layers. This feature can be used to model the non linear system with or without sigmoid function at plant output.

If you have any question, please feel free to contact Yizheng (yzliao at stanford dot edu).
